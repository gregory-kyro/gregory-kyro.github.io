## Key Machine Learning Projects

### T-ALPHA

A Hierarchical Transformer-Based Deep Neural Network for Proteinâ€“Ligand Binding Affinity Prediction with Uncertainty-Aware Self-Learning for Protein-Specific Alignment.

This is the current state-of-the-art deep learning model for predicting protein-ligand binding affinity, developed during the fourth year of my PhD.

### CardioGenAI

A generative deep learning framework for re-engineering drugs for reduced hERG-related cardiotoxicity while preserving their primary pharmacology.

Developed during the third year of my PhD, I applied this to specific programs within Pfizer R&D that were dealing with hERG liabilities.

### ChemSpaceAL

The first active learning methodology for fine-tuning a molecular generative model toward a specified protein target.

Developed during the second year of my PhD, this is being utilized in collaboration with experimental biochemists at Brown University to design small-molecule binders to the HNH domain of CRISPR-Cas9 to enhance its specificity for target DNA sequences.

### HAC-Net

A Hybrid Attention-based Convolutional Neural Network for Highly Accurate Protein-Ligand Binding Affinity Prediction.

Developed during the first year of my PhD, this deep learning model was the state of the art for predicting protein-ligand binding affinity and was used to identify a potential inhibitor of a G protein-coupled receptor whose overexpression leads to cancer, diabetes, and multiple sclerosis, as well as a potential antivirulence drug for drug-resistant staphylococcal infections.

## Computational Biology Tools

### molecular_dynamics_analyses

A collection of tools for analyzing molecular dynamics simulations, with a focus on protein-ligand interactions.

### eigenvector_centrality

A tool for analyzing information transfer in proteins based on eigenvector centrality in protein structure networks.

This method describes intraprotein information transfer as the propagation of electrostatic couplings throughout a secondary structure element-based network, which has led to valuable insights into the allosteric mechanisms of multiple important biological systems such as CRISPR-Cas9, imidazole glycerol phosphate synthase, and D-dopachrome tautomerase.

## Industry Projects

### SAGE

A platform that incorporates AI, cutting-edge reactions, and automated synthesis to reduce attrition in early-stage drug discovery.

This innovation was acquired by Merck Group in August 2024 and is currently being integrated across multiple teams within the company.

### PROTACs Interface Classification

Led the development of a deep learning model for classifying protein-protein interaction interfaces which was integrated into OpenEye Scientific's virtual screening pipeline for PROTACs.

### OpenAI LLM Fine-tuning

Contributed to the fine-tuning of OpenAI's large language models by crafting scientifically rigorous Q&A-based prompts pertaining to mathematics, physics, and chemistry to enhance the models' scientific domain expertise.

## Quantum Computing Research

Aided in the development of quantum computing-based methods for studying small molecules in collaboration with NVIDIA and Moderna.

Worked on quantum machine learning, quantum circuit construction, and quantum algorithms to accelerate drug discovery and molecular design processes.
